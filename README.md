# Academic Management Portal

This project has added a backend with PHP and user registration, login and authorisation processes have been performed. This backend allows users to register and log in, and provides authorisation and management functions according to different access levels. With features such as the separation of administrator and user roles, the functionality and user experience of the system has been increased. 

## Features

The functionality of the system has been increased with features such as separation of administrator and user roles. The administrator can change the role of the normal user
- **Login:** There is a login module that allows registered users to log in to the system. This feature provides access to the system by verifying username and password.
